        A comprehensive prompt that includes the URL(s) (up to 20) to fetch and
        specific instructions on how to process their content (e.g., "Summarize
        https://example.com/article and extract key points from
        https://another.com/data"). All URLs to be fetched must be valid and
        complete, starting with "http://" or "https://", and be fully-formed
        with a valid hostname (e.g., a domain name like "example.com" or an IP
        address). For example, "https://example.com" is valid, but "example.com"
        is not.
