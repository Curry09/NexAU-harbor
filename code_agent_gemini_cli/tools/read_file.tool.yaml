type: tool
name: read_file
description: >-
  Reads and returns the content of a specified file. If the file is large, the
  content will be truncated. The tool's response will clearly indicate if
  truncation has occurred and will provide details on how to read more of the
  file using the 'offset' and 'limit' parameters. Handles text, images (PNG,
  JPG, GIF, WEBP, SVG, BMP), audio files (MP3, WAV, AIFF, AAC, OGG, FLAC), and
  PDF files. For text files, it can read specific line ranges.

  Usage:
  - The file_path parameter can be an absolute or relative path
  - You can optionally specify a line offset and limit for paginating large files
  - For Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), consider using a dedicated notebook reader
  - You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response
