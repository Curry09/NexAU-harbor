description: >-
  Replaces text within a file. By default, replaces a single occurrence, but can
  replace all occurrences when `replace_all` is set to true. This tool requires
  providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting.
  Always use the Read tool to examine the file's current content before
  attempting a text replacement.

  The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this
  will be stated in the response.

  Expectation for required parameters:

  1. `file_path` MUST be the absolute path to the file to modify.

  2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all
  whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).

  3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with
  (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code
  etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string`
  and `new_string` are different.

  4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact
  literal text requirement.

  **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail.
  CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to
  change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text,
  matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple
  locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.

  5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic
  calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not
  finding a string to match.

  **Multiple replacements:** Set `replace_all` to true to replace ALL occurrences
  that match `old_string` exactly.
